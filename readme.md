# A collection of simple templates for common data visualizations

Many (most?) of these are not original creations, they often consist of code we regularly use from others with a note about where we got the code

* CartoDB
* D3
* HighCharts
* MapBox
* OpenLayers: careful, they use long, lat

You can find a list of map tile options under `common_assets/tileset_list.md`
